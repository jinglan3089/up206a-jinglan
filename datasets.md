#datasets
The first dataset is an estimated population of Los Angeles County by census tract, city Name, ethnicity, gender and age group.
The second dataset is the city boudaries in Los Angeles County.
The third dataset is LA county parks and open space.
By having these three sets of data, I hope to be able to identify the correlations of park and green spaces distribution and city demographics in Los Angeles County.
