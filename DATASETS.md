The first dataset is an estimated population of Los Angeles County by census tract, city Name, ethnicity, gender and age group.
Data source: https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.lacounty.gov/ai64-dnh8

The second dataset is the city boudaries in Los Angeles County.
Data source: https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/lacounty::la-county-city-boundaries/about

The third dataset is LA county parks and open space.
Data source: https://data.lacounty.gov/Sustainability/LA-County-Parks-and-Open-Space-2018/98vt-tkkj/data

By having these three sets of data, I hope to be able to identify the correlations between park and green spaces distribution and city demographics in Los Angeles County.
