The second dataset is the city boudaries in Los Angeles County. Having the dataset of city boundaries line in LA County allow user to clearly visualize the area of the city, and by incorporating the first dataset, I hope to have a explicit visualization of population density in each city.

The third dataset is LA county parks and open space. It displays the locations, name and types of park in LA County. 
Data source: https://data.lacounty.gov/Sustainability/LA-County-Parks-and-Open-Space-2018/98vt-tkkj/data

By having these three sets of data, I hope to be able to identify the correlations between park and green spaces distribution and city demographics in Los Angeles County.
