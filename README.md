# Profile
My name is Jinglan Lin. I am a first year MURP student with EAP concentration. I like playing tennis.
# Objectives
During undergraduate, I studied environmental issues, often time, with theoretical frameworks and conceptual ideas. I think it would be really helpful to gain understanding of technical skills and data analysis to have a more holistic knowledge of environmental and planning issues. Since I do not have much experience with GIS, for this course, my objectives would be to learn the basics of GIS including data analysis and to apply the knowledge identifying charateristics and issues in different locations. And surprisingly, I will be learning Python, which I am looking forward to as well! 
# Project ideas
Some projects that I am interested in is to look at the inequity of park or open space access in different neighborhoods by mapping out public open spaces in a region with the demographics of each neighborhood. Also, as an international student, I would like to explore topics that are transnational, but I do not have a concrete idea in mind yet.
